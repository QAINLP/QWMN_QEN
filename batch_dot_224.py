def batch_dot_224(x, y, axes=None):
    """Batchwise dot product.

    `batch_dot` is used to compute dot product of `x` and `y` when
    `x` and `y` are data in batch, i.e. in a shape of
    `(batch_size, :)`.
    `batch_dot` results in a tensor or variable with less dimensions
    than the input. If the number of dimensions is reduced to 1,
    we use `expand_dims` to make sure that ndim is at least 2.

    # Arguments
        x: Keras tensor or variable with `ndim >= 2`.
        y: Keras tensor or variable with `ndim >= 2`.
        axes: list of (or single) int with target dimensions.
            The lengths of `axes[0]` and `axes[1]` should be the same.

    # Returns
        A tensor with shape equal to the concatenation of `x`'s shape
        (less the dimension that was summed over) and `y`'s shape
        (less the batch dimension and the dimension that was summed over).
        If the final rank is 1, we reshape it to `(batch_size, 1)`.

    # Examples
        Assume `x = [[1, 2], [3, 4]]` and `y = [[5, 6], [7, 8]]`
        `batch_dot(x, y, axes=1) = [[17], [53]]` which is the main diagonal
        of `x.dot(y.T)`, although we never have to calculate the off-diagonal
        elements.

        Shape inference:
        Let `x`'s shape be `(100, 20)` and `y`'s shape be `(100, 30, 20)`.
        If `axes` is (1, 2), to find the output shape of resultant tensor,
            loop through each dimension in `x`'s shape and `y`'s shape:

        * `x.shape[0]` : 100 : append to output shape
        * `x.shape[1]` : 20 : do not append to output shape,
            dimension 1 of `x` has been summed over. (`dot_axes[0]` = 1)
        * `y.shape[0]` : 100 : do not append to output shape,
            always ignore first dimension of `y`
        * `y.shape[1]` : 30 : append to output shape
        * `y.shape[2]` : 20 : do not append to output shape,
            dimension 2 of `y` has been summed over. (`dot_axes[1]` = 2)
        `output_shape` = `(100, 30)`

    ```python
        >>> x_batch = K.ones(shape=(32, 20, 1))
        >>> y_batch = K.ones(shape=(32, 30, 20))
        >>> xy_batch_dot = K.batch_dot(x_batch, y_batch, axes=[1, 2])
        >>> K.int_shape(xy_batch_dot)
        (32, 1, 30)
